        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          My stock trading project has taught me a tremendous amount about data analysis and how to use it to make informed trading decisions.
          I have used solely python and have learned how to use pandas, matplotlib, and numpy to clean and analyze data.

        <p>
          My research into neural radiance fields and computer graphics has taught me a lot about machine learning.
          The best algorithms use an encoding scheme that is then input into a fully fused multilayer perceptron.
          I have learned how to use tensorflow and pytorch to train and test models.

        <h2><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/">CUDA</a></h2>
        <p>
          The best algorithms used in neural radiance fields take advantage of cuda programming and its powerful gpu acceleration capabilities.
          Because of such, I have learned how to use cuda and its unique capabilities to train and test models with cuda kernels.

        <h2><a href="https://80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quant_Trading_Guide_v0-1.pdf">Quantitative Trading</a></h2>
        <p>
          One area of interest for me is quantitative trading.
          I have always been interested in math and statistics.
          Then when I began picking up computer science, I wanted to combine all of my skills and saw quantitative trading as a natural fit.
          Additionally, the field of quantitative trading will be around for a long time even with the uprising of AI and machine learning.
          AI will be a great supplement to quantitative trading but it will never replace it.

        <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934">NeRFs and Computer Graphics</a></h2>
        <p>
          Another area of interest for me is neural radiance fields and computer graphics.
          NeRFs represent a groundbreaking advancement in computer graphics, combining deep learning with 3D scene reconstruction to generate realistic images.
          They are an important part of the future of computer graphics and have the potential to revolutionize the way we view and interact with the world.
          Additionally, the continual improvements in the machine learning world will be reflected in the field of computer graphics.
